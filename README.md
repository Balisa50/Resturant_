My Data Science Learning Journey

This repository is a reflection of my journey in learning data science, machine learning, and various tools and techniques from two prominent platforms: Axi Africa and DataCamp. It contains my progress on various coursework, projects, and the ML algorithms I've explored. Some parts of the repository are still incomplete, but I intend to keep updating this with my progress.
Platforms
Axi Africa

Axi Africa's Data Science certification program provided me with a solid foundation in data science principles. Key areas covered include:

    Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Methods to visually and statistically understand the data.

    Statistical Inference: Fundamentals of statistical methods and their application.

    Machine Learning Foundations: An introduction to supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

DataCamp

DataCamp's interactive learning platform allowed me to dive deeper into specific topics. The workflow covered in this section includes:

    Python for Data Science: A hands-on approach to Python, including data manipulation with pandas, NumPy, and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

    SQL for Data Science: Introduction to SQL queries for data analysis and manipulation.

    Machine Learning with Python: In-depth coverage of machine learning algorithms and their implementation using Scikit-Learn.

Projects and Workflows

The following are the main projects and workflows I've worked on:

    Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

        Tools: Pandas, NumPy

        Activities: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, feature engineering, normalization

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

        Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas

        Activities: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and relationships in data

    Machine Learning Algorithms

        Linear Regression: Implemented for predicting continuous variables.

        Logistic Regression: Applied for classification tasks.

        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Used for both regression and classification.

        Decision Trees: Built for classification and regression problems.

        Random Forest: Applied to improve model accuracy over decision trees.

        Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for both classification and regression.

        K-Means Clustering: Implemented for unsupervised learning tasks.

        Naive Bayes: Used for classification tasks with probabilistic interpretation.

    Data Visualization Projects

        Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

        Activities: Creating meaningful visual representations of data distributions, correlations, and predictions.

Upcoming Updates

This repository is still under construction. I will be adding more advanced topics and expanding on the following areas:

    Deep Learning: Exploring neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.

    Time Series Forecasting: Implementing ARIMA, LSTM, and other time-series models.

    Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms: Including Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost, and others.
